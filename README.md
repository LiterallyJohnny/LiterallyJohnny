### Frequently Asked Questions

*__Which do you prefer, Windows or Linux?__*

I prefer Windows, but I enjoy Linux too.

I have used Windows almost my entire life. My first experience with Windows (that I remember) was when I got my first
personal computer, the Windows Surface RT. It came preinstalled with Microsoft Windows 8.1 RT. It sucked. After a while,
I got an Inspiron 11-3168 laptop, which came with Windows 10 Home.

After a while, I got tired of how slow the laptop was, and I switched to Ubuntu for about a week. I then switched to
Kubuntu (Ubuntu with KDE Plasma as the desktop environment) for another week. After that, I switched to Arch Linux,
which I used for about 3 months. I loved how Linux worked, and how simple it is to update all of your programs at the
same time, and I enjoyed how customisable Linux was.

Eventually, I got tired of having to find alternative for *damn near every single application that didn't have a Linux
version*. I switched back to Windows 10 because it was so simple to make the OS do what I wanted. Windows 10 keeps
everything simple, so I don't have to worry about hardware and software incompatibilities, issues with the OS, etc.

*__What games do you play?__*

I play a lot of different games, but my favorite games are *Warframe*, *GTA V*, and the *Call of Duty* franchise. At the
time of writing this, I game on an Xbox One, but I plan on saving money to purchase components to build a gaming PC.
